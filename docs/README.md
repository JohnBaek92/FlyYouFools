# Fly You Fools

## MVP
Fly You Fools is a Lord Of The Rings inspired clone of [Platform Jumper](http://platformjumper.com) written in JavaScript utilizing Canvas. Sprites will be used for game images.

The goal of the game is to get as far away as possible from the starting location as the lovable dwarf, Gimli. The platforms will be staggered and moving from right to left so it is up to the user to guarantee that Gimli makes it to the next platform in order to escape the clutches of the oncoming orcs. The further Gimli survives, the higher the user's score. The rate at which the screen moves from right to left will also increase the longer that Gimli survives in order to add a layer of difficulty to the game.

- Gimli
- Different platforms
- Score
- Increased game speed the longer Gimli survives
