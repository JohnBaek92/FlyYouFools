# FlyYouFools

FlyYouFools is a "Lord Of The Rings" inspired platform runner game which was crafted utilizing Canvas, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS.
The game also makes use of Google's Firebase in order to keep track of scores from players all over the world.
The user plays the game by using the spacebar to make Gimli jump and land on the passing platforms.
The longer Gimli stays alive, the higher a user's score. Watch out though! The speed of the platforms increases every 1000 points.
