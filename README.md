After the user initializes the game by entering their name and hitting the "S" key to start the game, the user must then use the "W" key to make Gimli jump and land on the passing platforms. The longer Gimli stays alive, the higher a user's score. Watch out though! Gimli has only one life and the speed of the platforms increases every 1000 points.
